# intersection

Language: Python

To create synthesis images, potential intersection points between light rays and scene objects (here cylinders, spheres and cones) must be computed. This is exactly what we had to do in this project.
To do so, weed had to write a 3 dimensional equation of the considered surface, and inject into it the equation of the straight line representing the light ray.
